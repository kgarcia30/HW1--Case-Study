## Business Activities


The main focus is to improve the overall infrastructure to help weaken the ability for Fraudsters to get a hold of personal idenification. Here are 3 main areas to focus on:
 * Synthetic Identity Fraud - every year over $40 Billion is lost to identity fraud and over 20 Billion transactions due to failing authentication. 
 * Security- keeping main focus utilizing **Biometrics** to invalidate data leakage that would be a threat to identity theft. We want customers to feel they can invest in a safe and secure enviroment so they can f.ocus on their returns
 * Financial Inclusion- to focus on helping people who are undocumented and are underserved financially. This would help increase global GDPR. 


At True Stamp our solutions are created for use in multiple industries including banking, law enforcement, real estate, and many more industries.

Living in a society that's    growing rapidly in a tech savvy world. We need to understand the importance of Cypersecurity. Society really needs to realize the severity of Identity Theft. We all are guilty to carrying personal information even on our cell phones. 
After all, everyday life is run by an app. I think we can all come to agreement on protecting ourselves the way we should be protected.

## Landscape
* True Stamp is a Artificial Intelligence Platform

* Trust Stamp was one of 8 Blue Tulip Award winners of 2020.

* Innovation utilizing  biometric modalities and generating hashed-tokenized identity can only identify the people using their probabilistic AI. (facial recognition). Their technology works on and offline and can be used on any existing identity authentication methodology.

## Results
* With innovated Biometric technology, here at Trust Stamp were able to provide and insure a perfect match on Authenicating personal information from anywhere to login creditionals to creating a safeway for all online interactions. Trust Stamp stores data anonymously to keep it safe from data breaches.

* Here at Trust Stamp we measure our success based off of data extracted from accounts that were invalidated due to a flag a fraudster raised.

Due to having innovated technologies like integrated facial recognition. Its these sort of innovations that set Trust Stamp apart from the rest. Our facial recognition technology is the same being used in US and Mexico to help find Human Trafficking victims. Integration sets us apart from competitors.

## Recommendations

* In regards to Integration I would suggest adding a Credit Analysis Service. Since Trust Stamp offers Banking and Real Estate service. 
* Digitizing and automating the credit process could expedite the process of loan applications and would be very efficient helping customers pull together all personal data. Whether is be to integrate balance sheets or to keep all personal documentation together under one interface.
